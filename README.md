# Data-Structure-and-Algorithms-Specialization
This repository contains all the solutions of all assignments, starter files and other materials related to this specialization.
[Data Structures & Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms) <br/><br/>

Course 1 implemented using both C++ & Java. Others are implemented in Java. I will add C++ codes for other courses when my C++ implementation will be completed.<br />
